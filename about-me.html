      <p>
        Hello, I'm Jonas Garibay, a passionate computer science major with a deep love for technology and an unusual hobbyâ€”building custom mechanical keyboards. Ever since I embarked on my journey as a computer science student, I've been captivated by the intricate world of programming and the endless possibilities it offers. Beyond the lines of code, I find solace in crafting unique keyboards that not only enhance the typing experience but also reflect my commitment to precision and innovation. Whether I'm debugging a complex algorithm or soldering key switches, my dedication to perfection remains unwavering. Join me in exploring the intersection of technology and craftsmanship, where every keystroke is an opportunity to create something truly exceptional.
